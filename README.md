# Vibe

An Android App created by Team Mavericks - Yash Kr Gupta , Ainesh Chettri , Vardaan and Yash Singodia in HackVSIT 2018 Hackathon . 

#Inspiration
Being avid music lovers and inspired by the pentatonic scale as well as the HackVSIT to transfer data without the aid of the internet, we developed Vibe to offer a revolutionary new way of sharing data across multiple devices at sonic speed.

# What it does
Vibe allows a singular beacon device to establish and communicate data in aural format to multiple devices simultaneously.
Including the features of transferring data with the aid of Internet or Mobile network , We created an Voting App that we could use in our day to day life thought your mobiles , one can be the admin and other phones will be Voters . Its application in Voting can be used by several Enterprises and it's a brings a value to the Human Resources in a company.
It also includes Chatting App , which could help in secretly chatting with your friend who is sitting nearby and don't want unwanted attention , as it produces voice no one can decrypt, and without the encoding algorithm , it would be just gibberish. 
Plus, All the applications we have linked through in one single app, and that could be accesible using just swiping left ( Voting App ) and right ( Chat App ) .


# How we built it
By making calls to Diva Digital Voices API we encoded file data into pentatonic scale data for transmission, and used native Android playback and microphone recording to read and write data across devices.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
In the technological world where no one touches theres area of technologies , we handled it fairly well . We successfully built the app and It is properly implemented.
